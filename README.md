A branching narrative novel written in [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink), this repository hosts its generated website. For learning and testing purposes only. Feel free to read it if you're interested.

If you're interested in branching narrative novels, let me recommend this software. You can use it to write a novel that accumulates values and determines plot direction based on reader choices - it's really exciting! The advantage of [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink) over other choice-based narrative editors is that it doesn't follow the typical tree-branch framework for storytelling, but instead uses transitions between different passages to create a story with infinite possibilities.
